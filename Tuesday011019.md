This webpage presents data and analyses of Alsiö et al. 2019 in *Psychopharmacology* "Dopamine D2-like receptor stimulation blocks negative feedback in visual and spatial reversal learning in the rat: behavioural and computational evidence"

We tested a number of hypotheses <!-- note that lists need to be preceded by a blank row -->

1. Dopamine D2 receptor stimulation impairs reversal learning by blocking learning from negative feedback
2. D2-related impairment will only be observed at higher concentrations which bind post-synaptically
3. Dopamine D1 receptor blockade impairs reversal learning by blocking learning from positive feedback

# Introduction

The work in this manuscript is based on the following, novel touchscreen task to study negative and positive feedback in reversal learning:

# Inserting R code chunks -- Gapminder examples
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

pop_data <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")

#create a table with only European countries in 2007 sorted by life expectency (high--low)

euro_data_tbl <- pop_data %>% 
                    filter(continent == "Europe" & year == 2007) %>% 
                    arrange(desc(lifeExp)) %>% 
                    select(-continent, -year)

```

The top countries in Europe in 2007 wrt life expectency

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(euro_data_tbl)
```


<!--
    include = FALSE do not display the code and results in the page after it is knitted.
    The R code however still runs and therefore the variables or results in this code chunk can be used by the other chunks.

    echo = FALSE does not display the code, but it displays the results in the rendered file.

    message = FALSE does not display any messages that are generated by the code chunk in the rendered file.

    warning = FALSE does not display warnings that are generated by code chunk in the rendered file. -->


```{r}
#create data set that will be used to create an image
euro_data_fig <- pop_data %>% 
                      filter(continent=="Europe") %>% 
                      mutate(year=as.factor(year))
```

```{r fig.cap="life expectancy in Europe"}
euro_data_fig %>% 
                  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) +
                  geom_violin()
